## Children typing game.

During the start of the game, the car will be located on the left hand side of the page. To complete the game, the car will need to reach the right side of the page. For player to finish the game they will have to enter a string of letter that type out:

"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

For every correct key-stroke the car travels right to the finish line. Any missed key-stroke the car does not move.

User will be playing against a timer that activates at the start of the game and stops at the end of the game.

At the end there will be a popup that notifies the user of how fast they completed the game.
